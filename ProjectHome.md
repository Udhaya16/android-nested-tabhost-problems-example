This project shows two unexpected behaviors when TabHosts are nested in Android. This behavior will result in a crash. To overcome these problems solutions are also provided in a separate project.
# First Unexpected Behavior #
When creating a dialog in nested tab hosts the default approach will result in an exception.
# Second Unexpected Behavior #
Within nested tab hosts a click on the search button of your phone will cause a crash. The normal behavior would be to show the default search box.
